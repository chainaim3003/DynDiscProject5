// ================= MESSAGE SIGNER INTERFACE =================
// Contract every signing implementation must satisfy.
//
// Two implementations:
//   - PlainHashSigner: sha256 envelope hash, no crypto identity (today)
//   - VleiSignifySigner: KERI signatures via signify-ts (Phase 2)
//
// Selection happens via getMessageSigner() in ./index.ts based on
// SIGNING_MODE env var. No silent fallback — if SIGNING_MODE=vlei and
// signify can't init, startup fails.
